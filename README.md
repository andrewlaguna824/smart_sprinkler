Independent Research Project for ECE 4999

Building and programming a do-it-yourself web-enabled irrigation system.  The device downloads weather forecasts from the web and makes irrigation decisions based on those forecasts. 

So far, the device can take in a location input via Serial communication. Next, the device uses this location and accesses openweathermap.org api to check the inputted location's forecast.  Based on this forecast data, the device decides whether or not to turn on irrigation.
